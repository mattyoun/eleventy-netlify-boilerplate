Hey there! I'm an Account Executive at Netlify. While I'm on the sales team, I like to learn more about the technology I'm helping to sell out in the world. With Netlify, we tout that it's easier to build websites and deploy faster. Well, I thought I'd dogfood the product myself even on this little personal site.
